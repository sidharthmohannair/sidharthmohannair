## Background

B.Tech in Electrical & Electronics (2017), M.Tech in Energy Systems (2019) — Amal Jyothi College of Engineering.

First project in 2013 — water level indicator with transistors and LEDs. Then 555 timers, hand-etched PCBs, 8051 microcontrollers, Arduino, and eventually drones. Co-founded i-Era Technical Solutions during B.Tech final year.

3 patents filed. DGCA certified drone pilot.
